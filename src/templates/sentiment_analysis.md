# Sentiment Analysis

### Overview:
---
<code>Sentiment Analysis</code> is a process of analyzing text or speech data to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind it. The purpose of sentiment analysis is to identify the attitude, opinions, or emotions of the author or speaker towards a specific topic, product, service, or person.

Sentiment analysis can be performed using various techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. These techniques help in identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiment expressed in the text or speech data.

Sentiment analysis is used in various fields such as marketing, social media analysis, customer feedback analysis, and political analysis. In marketing, sentiment analysis helps companies understand customer opinion about their products and services. In social media analysis, sentiment analysis helps in identifying trends and opinion about topics and events on social media platforms. In customer feedback analysis, sentiment analysis helps in identifying customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction with products and services. In political analysis, sentiment analysis helps in understanding public opinion about political candidates, parties, and issues.

The process to do sentiment analysis modeling typically involves the following steps:
1. <b>Data collection</b>: The first step is to collect a dataset of text or speech data to train the sentiment analysis model. This dataset should include a variety of text or speech samples with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
2. <b>Data cleaning and pre-processing</b>: Once you have collected the dataset, the next step is to clean and pre-process the data. This involves removing any noise from the data, such as punctuation, special characters, and stop words. You may also need to perform techniques such as stemming and lemmatization to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
3. <b>Feature extraction</b>: The next step is to extract features from the pre-processed data. Common techniques for feature extraction include bag-of-words, n-grams, and word embeddings.
4. <b>Model selection</b>: After feature extraction, the next step is to select a suitable model for sentiment analysis. Common models for sentiment analysis include logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN).
5. <b>Model training and evaluation</b>: Once you have selected a model, the next step is to train the model using the pre-processed data and evaluate its performance. This involves dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets and using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's performance.
6. <b>Hyperparameter tuning</b>: To optimize the performance of the model, you may need to perform hyperparameter tuning. This involves adjusting the parameters of the model to find the optimal values that maximize the performance metrics.
7. <b>Deployment</b>: Once you have trained and evaluated the model, the final step is to deploy the model in a production environment where it can be used to analyze sentiment in real-time.

### Metrics:
---
There are several metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of sentiment analysis models. Here are some commonly used metrics:

- <b>Accuracy</b>: This metric measures the overall correctness of the predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples in the dataset.

- <b>Precision</b>: This metric measures the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.

- <b>Recall</b>: This metric measures the proportion of true positives to the total number of actual positive samples in the dataset. It is calculated as TP/(TP + FN), where FN is the number of false negatives.

- <b>F1 score</b>: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of both metrics. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

- <b>ROC curve and AUC</b>: These metrics are used to evaluate binary classification models, where the sentiment is either positive or negative. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold values. AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a single value that represents the performance of the model across all possible threshold values.

- <b>Confusion matrix</b>: This is a matrix that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in the model's predictions. It can be used to calculate other metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.
